[Installation]

1. Place the "MaxBoy" folder into your max's "scripts" folder (usually at: "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 20XX\scripts")

2. Either drag in "MaxBoy_Installer.ms" into the max viewport- or if that doesn't work, run the same script by going to "Max's toolbar" -> "Scripting" -> "Run Script..." (It will print in the console to confirm)

3. Go to "Max's toolbar" -> "Customize User Interface..." -> "Toolbars tab" -> Create a new toolbar (to the right), and call it "MaxBoy"

4. Now a tiny, empty floater should've popped up. While keeping the "Group" as "Main UI", change the "Category" to MaxBoy.

5. Within the "Action" list, there should be three items listed. Drag out each of them into the floater you just created previously.

6. Doc the floater somewhere, or keep it as is for easy acess! (you should probably save the UI after this to keep the change)

7. Done! You should be able to execute the tools from the floater now!


!IMPORTANT!: If you're installing a new version of the scripts, it will not overwrite your "PipeBoy_Settings.ini" file currently! This is to avoid discarding your current project settings- but it might cause errors in the future.
I'll try and work around it for the future, and if it turns out that you're gonna HAVE to overwrite the file, I'll make sure to notify. 


If anything throws any errors after these steps, try running the installer script again to see if the problem persists. 

Please inform me regarding any bugs you come across!


Thanks for trying it out, and have fun! :)


[Update]

1. Put all included files from the package into the same location in the scripts folder

2. Either run the update function from your UI floter, or run the install script from within 3Ds Max to install the files


[Uninstall]

1. Remove the scripts toolbar + files from the same install directory.

2. Go to "X:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\<ReleaseNumber> - 64bit\ENU\scripts\" and delete the "MaxBoy" folder

3. If you want to do a "full uninstall" and remove the macroscript categories, go to: "X:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\<ReleaseNumber> - 64bit\ENU\usermacros", and delete the files "MaxBoy-PipeBoyTool.mcr" and "MaxBoy-ToolBoyTool.mcr"
