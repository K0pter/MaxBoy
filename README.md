# MaxBoy

MaxBoy is the "collective name" I've decided using for these tools. For some reason.

The suite so far contains two tools; "ToolBoy" and "PipeBoy". Each having their own purpose and functions.

ToolBoy is a collection of "macros", functions and other neatly packaged processes that helps with general asset creation. It's meant as an "assisting tool" that you can leave floating around when you work, fully collapsed and waiting or expanded to your liking. 

PipeBoy is a pipeline tool, made to assist with iteration times, and keeping your projects neatly structured- by following a standard "directory mirroring" structure (if you want). It has a project manager attached to it to manage and store settings, specific to your projects.

Both tools have particular ways of working with some of the mechanics within, so a manual will be created to explain and unlock all the different knobs and buttons.

This is being actively or at least "passively" worked on, as I keep adding and adjusting things the more I use the tools myself in my own projects. I felt there was a need for tools like this in my day-to-day work as a tech-artist/ animator/ level designer. Now, after I've felt the clear improvements in my workflows after developing the tools and using them, I want others to be able to get similar boosts- even though they might not be into scripting themselves.
